This is what I use to finish setting up kali after running [pimpmyi3](https://github.com/Dewalt-arch/pimpmyi3).

Run i3_config_kali.sh as root after pimpmyi3 is finished and you've rebooted.

Then run i3_final_setup.sh after that and you're logged in as kali user.

This is a first version and hasn't been tested yet.
